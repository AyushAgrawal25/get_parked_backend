Sockets
    slots
        Node: each slotId works as a room for each slot
            Each user can join to any slot room they want.
            Only the slot room will be updated on the basis of slot updates.

    This way you can call any socket from any where.
    global.io.sockets.sockets.get(socket.id).emit("transaction-update", {"fuck":"socket id "+socket.id});

    This way you can call any room from any where
    global.io.to("room123").emit("room-test", {
        "data":"You nailed it..."
    });
        

    Users 
        Note: each user is mapped to some sockets using its user id
            and that global map is used for updating users about the changes.

        userData:{
            'authorization':'token'
        }
